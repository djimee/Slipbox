# Slipbox
A unique note-taking tool for academics and students.


## About

This project aims to provide academics, students or anyone wanting to take notes with the ability to use a digital version of Niklas Luhmann’s ‘slip-box’ note taking method, making them easy to write and organise. Notes can be written, indexed and grouped into a group of notes known as a slipbox. This project was designed and developed using Ruby on Rails by a group of students at the University of Sheffield.


### Notable Features

* Create slipboxes and view them on a user's account page
* Display all notes related to a slipbox in a structured tree diagram
* Include other collaborators to edit notes
* Manage all your notes' references

### Deployment
*QA -> Demo -> Production* using the `epi-deploy` gem.
