# Slipbox

A unique note-taking tool for academics and students.

## About

This project aims to provide academics, students or anyone wanting to take notes with the ability to use a digital version of Niklas Luhmann’s ‘slip-box’ note taking method, making them easy to write and organise. Notes can be written, indexed and grouped into a group of notes known as a slipbox. This project was designed and developed using Ruby on Rails by a group of students at the University of Sheffield.

### Notable Features

- Create slipboxes and view them on a user's account page

- Include other collaborators to edit your slipboxes/trees/notes
- Manage all your notes' references
